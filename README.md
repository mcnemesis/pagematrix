Page Matrix
==========

**A tool for exploring more of the web in an efficient (and simple) way**. Yes, that's exactly why pagematrix was needed in the first place.

Maybe you just want to explore all the major websites about dogs, or just wish to explore art across various regional domains, or you just want to check if one of your favorite domain keywords has a free slot, or if your domain might be accidentally confused with some xxx website,...

This tool would just help you find answers to these problems or get closer to solving them, easily, efficiently, and right in your browser.
